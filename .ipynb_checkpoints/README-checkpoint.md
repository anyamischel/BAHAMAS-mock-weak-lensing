## Calculating Shear from BAHAMAS Simulations for Mock Weak Gravitational Lensing Image Generation

### Project Description:
This repository loads pre-run BAHAMAS Simulations, which are large-scale N-body simulations of the universe's baryonic and dark matter content, and evaluates and plots the convergence, shear, and magnification fields.

### Installation
Git clone the repository and ensure that your local machine has all the python packages listed in requirements.txt.

### File Overview
This repository consists of the following main files:
Lensing.py
Simulation.py
BHMSim.py
Running_BHM_Sims.py
requirements.txt

Along with a couple jupyter notebook versions (.ipynb) of these files:
BHMSim_nb.ipynb
Running_BHM_Sims_nb.ipynb
